# Complexity analysis

## Complexity analysis
A process of determinating of how efficient an algotithm is. Complexity analysis usually involves finding both the time complexity and the space complexity of an algorithm.

## Time Complexity 
A measure of how fast an algorithm runs. It is expressed using Big O notation

## Space Cmplexity
A measure of much much auxiliary memory an algorithm takes up. It's expressed using Big O notation

# Memory

## Bit
Short fot binary digit, a bit is a fundamnetal unit of information in Computer science that represents a state with one of two values: 0 or 1

## Byte
A group of eight bits. For example 01101000 is a byte. A single byte can represent up to 256 data values
Since a binary number is a number can be expressed with only two symbols: 0 and 1, a byte can effectively represent all of the numbers between 0 and 255, inclusive, in binary format. The following bytes represent the numbers 1,2,3 and 4 in bianry format:
1: 00000001
2: 00000010
3: 00000011
4: 00000100

## Fixed-With Integer
An Integer represented by a fixed amount of bites. For example a 32-bit integer is and integer represented by 32 bits (4-bytes) and 64-bit integer is an integer represented by 64 bits (8 bytes)


## Memory
Broadly speaking memory is the foundational layer of computing, where all data are stored
- Data stored in memory is stored in bytes and by extension bits
- Bytes in memory can point to other bytes in memory so as to store references to other data
- The amount of memory that a machine has is bounded, making it valeuable to limit how much memory an algorithm take up
- Accessing a byte or fixed number of bytes (like 4 or 8 bytes in this case 32 or 64 bit integers) is an elementary operation, which can be loosely treated as a single unit of operational work
